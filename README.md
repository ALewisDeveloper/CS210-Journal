Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I was interviewing for a company called Chada Tech. They wanted me to complete a coding skills test to "audition" for the role. I was asked to create a clock with two views. The two views were 12 hour and 24 hour. To stand out among the competition, I needed to create a program that displayed both views simultaneously and allowed for user input. 

What did you do particularly well?
I felt like I created the loop for the user input particularly well. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel like I could have enhanced my code by compacting the function decelerations. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Finding a way to store the two different formats was the most challenging for me. I overcame this by looking up other examples of similar coding. W3schools is a resource that I always use to help myself to get more familiar with coding. I will be adding GitHub to my resources. I have heard of it, but I never dug into the community. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
It set me up for the foundation of how to create a solid loop, allowing me to let it shine throughout the course. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by including comments. Comments allow other software developers to comprehend my work.
